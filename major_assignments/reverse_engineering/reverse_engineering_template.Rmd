## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, [As police struggle to solve homicides, Baltimore residents see an 'open season for killing'](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/as-police-struggle-to-solve-homicides-baltimore-residents-see-an-open-season-for-killing/2018/12/26/7ee561e4-fb24-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html)

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(refinr)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
# Load required data
baltimore_homicide <- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 


```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: City police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014; last year (2017), the rate was just 27 percent, a 14 percentage point drop.
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]
After the results of our analysis, the statistic that city police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014 is correct. The statistic that police made an arrest in 27 percent of homicides in 2017 is also correct. Lastly, by combining the 2014 homicide percentage and the 2017 percentage data frames and then subtracting the two percentages from each other, we confirmed that it was a 14 percentage point drop between 2014 and 2017.

```{r}
#2014
percent_2014 <- baltimore_homicide %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2014-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2014-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(disposition)%>%
   summarise(
    count= n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(total_homicides = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed by arrest") %>%
  mutate(percentage2014 = count / total_homicides)

#2017
percent_2017 <- baltimore_homicide %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2017-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2017-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(disposition)%>%
   summarise(
    count= n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(total_homicides = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed by arrest") %>%
  mutate(percentage2017 = count / total_homicides) 
  
#difference
total_2014_2017 <- bind_cols(percent_2014,percent_2017)%>%
  mutate(percentage2017-percentage2014)

```

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**:In Chicago, the homicide arrest rate has dropped 21 percentage points, in Boston it has dropped 12 points and in St. Louis it is down 9. (2014 vs 2017)
* **Analysis summary**: Through filtering the data to only homicides that resulted in an arrest in 2014 and 2015 in Chicago, we subtracted the percent of total homicides from each year to confirm that the homicide arrest rate in Chicago has dropped 21 percentage points. We did this same process for the cities of Boston and St. Louis to confirm that Boston dropped 12 percentage points and St. Louis dropped 9 percentage points.

### Sentence 3

* **Sentence text**:  Of the 1,002 homicides between 2015 and the beginning of this year, just 252 — one out of every four — resulted in an arrest. 
* **Analysis summary**: Through filtering the data by homicides between the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2017, we can confirm that there were 1,002 homicides in this time period. By grouping the data by dispositions listed as "closed by arrest", we can confirm that 252 cases resulted in arrest. By finding the percent of cases resulting in arrest by the total homicide cases, we can confirm that one out of ever four case resulted in an arrest.

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
baltimore_homicide %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2015-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2017-12-31")) %>%
group_by(disposition)%>%
   summarise(
    count= n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(total_homicides = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed by arrest") %>%
  mutate(percentage = count / total_homicides) 

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 4

* **Sentence text**: Baltimore is also one of 30 cities that have seen an increase in homicides in recent years, with the greatest raw number increase in killings of any city other than Chicago, which has four times the population.
* **Analysis summary**: After creating a data frame that compares the difference between homicides in 2014 and 2017 per city, the statement made by the Washington Post is incorrect. Baltimore is one of 25 cities that have seen an increase in homicides in recent years. The second statement is correct. Baltimore has the greatest raw number increase in killings, 129, of any city other than Chicago, which has an increase of 236 homicides. The data does not have information concerning the population of each city, but by Google search, Baltimore has a population of approximately 609,032 and Chicago has a population of approximately 2.71 million. Chicago has 4.45 times the population as Baltimore, which can be rounded down to four times the population. Therefore, the last statement is correct as well. 

```{r}
#Code that organizes top 30 cities (2014 v 2017)
homicide_2014 <- baltimore_homicide %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), 
  format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2014-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2014-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(
    count= n()) %>%
   arrange(desc(count))


homicide_2017 <- baltimore_homicide %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character( reported_date), 
  format="%Y%m%d")) %>%
  filter(reported_date >= as.Date("2017-01-01"), reported_date <= as.Date("2017-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(
    count= n()) %>%
   arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  rename(count2 = count)

alldata <- homicide_2014 %>%
  inner_join(homicide_2017)

alldata <- alldata %>%
  mutate(difference=count2 - count) %>%
  arrange(desc(difference))
